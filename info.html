		“The Art Club gallery is a collection of artworks from various people around the school.” explains Zach Standley, Gallery Curator, “It’s basically a display of all the hidden talents people have”.  The gallery can be further described as an opportunity for students to practice their artistry outside of a classroom setting. It will feature art pieces chosen by a committee of judges. The judges consist of a group of unbiased individuals with knowledge of the elements of art.

		This all stemmed from the Art Club wanting to include more people in their ever expanding activities. They hope this school wide function will wake others to partake in the arts. “I think that this will make art more recognized throughout the school,” Standley says, “It also shows people that it is okay to be yourself.”

		Every month a theme will be posted on flyers around the school for a chance for anyone to create an art piece to be hung up at the gallery. Additonaly, the gallery accepts artwork created by any media, whether it’d be photography, drawing, painting, sculpture, etc. The Art Club wants people to create art that they enjoy doing. “We obviously appreciate diversity.” Standley comments.
